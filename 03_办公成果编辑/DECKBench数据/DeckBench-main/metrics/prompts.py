coherence_prompt = """Scoring Criteria (Five-Point Scale)
1 Point (Poor):
Terminology are inconsistent, or the logical structure is unclear, making it difficult for the audience to
understand.
2 Points (Fair):
Terminology are consistent and the logical structure is generally reasonable, with minor issues in
transitions.
3 Points (Average):
The logical structure is sound with fluent transitions; however, it lacks basic background information.
4 Points (Good):
The logical flow is reasonable and include basic background information (e.g., speaker or
acknowledgments/conclusion).
5 Points (Excellent):
The narrative structure is engaging and meticulously organized with detailed and comprehensive
background information included.

content_prompt = """Scoring Criteria (Five-Point Scale):
1 Point (Poor):
The text on the slides contains significant grammatical errors or is poorly structured, making it difficult to
understand.
2 Points (Below Average):
The slides lack a clear focus, the text is awkwardly phrased, and the overall organization is weak, making it
hard to engage the audience.
3 Points (Average):
The slide content is clear and complete but lacks visual aids, resulting in insufficient overall appeal.
4 Points (Good):
The slide content is clear and well-developed, but the images have weak relevance to the theme, limiting
the effectiveness of the presentation.
5 Points (Excellent):
The slides are well-developed with a clear focus, and the images and text effectively complement each
other to convey the information successfully.

You are playing the role of a researcher improving the previous deck based on the gold deck.
Your goal is to generate editing request prompt by comparing the previous deck with the gold deck to edit the previous deck closer to the gold deck.
When you generate the editing request, focus on how to edit the previous deck content following th instructions bellow. 

## Tool Use
- You can access files using the provided file paths and mcp servers.
- Use `filesystem__read_file` to read md and html files.
- Use `filesystem__write_file` to write md and html files.
- Do NOT call any other tools.

## Persona
- Follow the instructions in `user_persona` for tone, phrasing, and style.
- The persona should not change the quality of the resulting edits, only the phrasing of the prompt itself.

## Core Principles
- Your goal is to generate editing request prompt to edit the `previous_deck` to be more similar to the `gold_deck`.
- Always start by comparing previous deck content with the gold deck content. These are your primary sources.
- Assume the gold deck represents the ground truth version.
- Editing request can include one of the following types of editing, but not limited to them: "revise", "update", "improve" or "add new slides".
- Only use the original paper content in file `paper_info_path` if the decks do not contain enough information AND the edit is clearly motivated by missing or outdated content in the paper.
- The editing request must be self-contained and **cannot refer to files, decks, or content that the downstream assistant does not have access to**.
- Each response must describe exactly one clear editing request that edits the previous deck to be closer to the gold deck.
- Focus on editing the previous deck content. And don't try to edit the gold deck content. 
- Only output the level of detail specified in `user_persona`.
- Don't repeat the same editing request generated in previous turns.

## Output Behavior
- Only issue **one editing request** per response.
- After outputting the request, stop immediately. Do not continue listing further edits.
- Do not give HTML code; use English only.

## Output Format
Strictly output a JSON object with a single key `"editing_request"`:

{
"editing_request": "<your request here>"
